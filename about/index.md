My name is Anthony Ionno and I currently live in Toronto, Ontario with my wife Amanda and our very energetic dog Gordie. In my spare time I enjoy playing video games, going on lengthy camping trips, throwing dodgeballs at people competitively, and keeping up to date on the best places to eat and drink in this awesome city. I currently work within the energy industry, using data to develop, inform, and assess energy policies within the Province. I graduated with a Masterâ€™s degree in Economics from the University of Toronto, where I specialized in Applied Econometrics.
